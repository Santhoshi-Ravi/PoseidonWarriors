              "{'0': {'raw text': 'The great white swiped for my head, but missed, because another had got there firstIt was a warm winter’s day in South Africa and I planned to go surfing at Nahoon Reef. I was 15 and had just finished my first day back at school after the winter break. The reef is famous among surfers for its powerful waves and popularity with sharks. If you see lots of birds diving into the reef or notice a strong fishy smell in the air, you should not surf there.But on that day in July 2000, the waves were perfect, just over head high, and there was no wind. The water was warm for winter, too. The conditions were too good to resist.The session started off well, but about an hour and a half in, my brother and some of my friends got out of the water because they felt uneasy; there was the faintest whiff of sardines, which can attract sharks. A few of us stayed in. Finally, I saw my first big wave, but as I was about to hit it, two four-metre great white sharks attacked me.It happened so quickly that I had no idea what was going on. One shark hit me with a lot of force, throwing me into the air; in a split second, it grabbed my hand and surfboard in its jaws, dragging me under the water with it. The shock numbed the pain of its bite. Under the water, another shark swiped for my head and my shoulders, but missed, because the other had got me first.That second shark ended up saving my life. Perhaps startled by the competition, the first shark lost its grip on me. I thought I was dreaming; everything seemed to slow down. I started to feel pain and the next thing I knew I was staring a shark straight in the face. I think the shark was confused because it stared back at me for a few moments as if in awe. Its mouth was wide open; I could see a huge set of teeth and a dark black eye. It bolted past me and I felt a shove from behind – it must have brushed along my back, but thankfully it had not bitten me. After it passed, I swam to the surface as fast as I could.When I got there, I saw my surfboard lying in front of me with a bite mark on it. As I climbed on and pulled, I saw that my right hand was hanging off. It had a gaping hole in it and my wristbone was sticking out after the shark had bitten right through it. There was a tear in my wetsuit and blood was rushing out of my hands. I panicked, my adrenaline going into overdrive.All the other surfers were paddling frantically towards the beach: no one stayed in the water to help me out. I was about 100 metres out at sea, all by myself, and the ocean went completely flat – there was no wave for me to catch. When you surf at Nahoon, you always have the thought of sharks in the back of your mind. The reef is off the coast of the Eastern Cape, where most fatal shark attacks happen in Africa, and I had heard the stories: sharks going back for a second and third time to finish a surfer off. I was shaking, crying and panicking, seeing my life flash in front of me, realising that I could die and feeling as if I was in a nightmare.Then, out of the blue, a big wave rocked up and I managed to ride it on my stomach, before paddling furiously for another 20 minutes through a deep-water channel. Every time I took a stroke, my fingers felt as if they were going to fall off. I could feel the water rushing through my bones, tendons and joints. The whole time, I was worried that the sharks would come back.Eventually I made it to dry land. I felt a huge surge of a relief, but my wrist was bleeding severely. Someone tied my arm with a surfboard leg rope to slow the bleeding and my brother rushed me to hospital. I had to wait about five hours for surgery, but I was fortunate enough to have been assigned to one of the best hand surgeons in the country, who managed to sew my fingers back together. The shark had bitten through my arm as well as my wristbone, so that was in a cast for a while. I still have a scar on my right wrist, another on my pinkie and one on my ring finger that runs almost from the top to the tip.That day changed my life, but it hasn’t stopped me surfing. After the attack, I started a surfing school in Jeffreys Bay and later relocated to Norway to teach the national surfing team. I was more afraid of sharks before my attack. Now I’m just grateful to be alive. • As told to Jack DuttonDo you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com{{topLeft}}{{bottomLeft}}{{topRight}}{{bottomRight}}{{.}}',\n",

Prior to Opening Night Live, Xbox held its own stream. It was a bit of a damp squib with no genuinely huge announcements, but we did get to see more of Forza Horizon 5, which looks better and better each time we see it.Opening Night Live itself was packed with impressive showings, however. We got a December 8 release date for Halo Infinite, a fresh look at Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga and the remarkably baffling DokeV.This week, TechRadar updated its Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review and as it might be the device that actually convinces us of the future of the foldable phone, we thought we’d update you too, with the help of our US Editor-in-Chief Matt Swider.The latest episode of Totally Rated features a breakdown of the phone, its features, and a discussion on why it's the best foldable phone to date. Be sure to check it out, or read our review linked above for a more thorough deep dive into why we love the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 so much.Finally, after months and months of waiting, speculation and no shortage of insanity, we got a trailer for the much-anticipated Spider-Man: No Way Home!\\xa0It’s been long rumored that the movie would feature many returning characters and actors from the previous Spider-Man films, and we think we may have spotted a couple of clues that could lead to even more familiar faces making a comeback.Grab your shiniest tin foil hat, as we could've sworn we saw Charlie Cox's Daredevil in the trailer, complete with a sign that could hint the lawyer will legally represent Peter Parker in the movie. That, or it's a giant red herring and Marvel's playing us.Other hints were a little more blatant. Not only is Alfred Molina reprising his role as Doctor Octopus (gloriously revealed at the end of the trailer) but we also saw a pumpkin bomb accompanied by a very familiar sounding laugh.Could Willem Dafoe also be reprising his role as the Green Goblin? We certainly hope so, as Norman Osborn was arguably one of the more compelling - and entertaining - characters in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.Going back to Doc Ock for a moment, the good doctor is able to address Peter by name. Surely he'd only recognize the Tobey Maguire version of Parker? If so, we could well see some multiverse shenanigans happen in No Way Home, thanks in no small part to Doctor Strange, of course.Suffice to say, we're extremely excited to watch Spider-Man: No Way Home this December. We're sure the trailer wasn't being entirely sincere with us, so we can't wait to see where we were right, and where we were being misled.Totally Rated\\xa0features reviews and opinions of what's hot and what's not in the tech and gaming world.Bringing together leading titles from across the industry, we hear first hand from those who have reviewed - and rated - the very latest games and products on the market.New episodes of\\xa0Totally Rated\\xa0will roll out every week.Sign up to get breaking news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more, plus the hottest tech deals!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

              " '11': {'raw text': \"CEO at\\xa0Planbox\\xa0and author of the Future-Fit Manifesto. I help organizations build a sustainable culture of innovation.gettyPurpose-driven innovation happens with an unparalleled urgency, focus and determination to find what’s missing. The first 48 hours are especially critical if you want help from your innovation community to unearth ideas for untapped opportunities. Doing so yields benefits like creating a first mover’s advantage or solving tough problems that plague your organization each and every day. If you’re seeking a quick business hack, then hackathons could be your go-to event to spur results in the shortest possible time frame.\\xa0As the Future-Fit movement takes shape, organizations understand that the art of relentlessly challenging the status quo is essential. Hackathons, and other time-based and themed innovation activities of this kind, provide a perfect outlet to unleash your employees’ creativity and help it flourish. But a lot of organizations struggle with building positive tension in their pursuit for change.Hackathons come with their own set of challenges and questions, but before you get started, here’s what you should know to make the most of your efforts.Break The RoutineHackathons are in and of themselves a disruption to normal work life that bring your innovation community together to help solve a problem immediately. Unfortunately, standard operating procedures keep larger organizations from engaging in these activities. Worse yet, this makes everyday work feel like groundhog day for many employees. Routines, bureaucracies, processes and systems reign supreme. Sometimes, general feedback is requested, often through surveys, but with no real objective in mind. The status quo is cherished and protected in the name of the supposed greater good.Hackathons help to break through the daily humdrum by bringing life and soul back into the workplace, stirring up people’s imaginations in a highly collaborative setting gives them a greater sense of purpose and connection to your organization and its mission, and focusing these efforts creates the right sense of urgency that breeds results.\\xa0Get Juices FlowingIt’s hard to keep people interested and focused on the same subject for long. When it comes to purpose-driven innovation, the first 48 hours are crucial in motivating solution seekers to find and piece together clues.As with any crowdsourcing initiative, a premium is placed on the quantity of leads rather than the quality of them. In hackathons, as in any innovation activity for that matter, it’s imperative to start with a bang and ensure the event is launched with lots of focus, positive energy and a sense of fearlessness that gets creative juices flowing and empowers every type of idea to emerge without any form of judgment. The vibe has to be infectious and inclusive early on so that everyone feels like they can speak their mind and share their creativity. These events are truly inspiring as they bring people together from all walks of life, so to speak, to collectively solve the task at hand. This initial rally for ideas is a proven method for discovering novel and innovative ideas for long-standing problem areas.\\xa0Frame What’s MissingLess is more when it comes to defining what solution you’re looking for. The statement must be fairly straightforward and strikingly simple in what information it communicates. The concise nature of the announcement makes it easy for everyone involved, especially those you’re trying to get ideas from.The single most important element of success in an innovation activity such as a hackathon is how you define what the challenge is and what you’re looking to solve. If you’re new at this and don’t have considerable experience running such events, then the good news is you can always seek professional help to write up a winning problem statement.Avoid TheaterHackathons have spread like wildfire in different industries and business areas. The event now takes on different names, forms and durations depending on the business outcome being sought: Innovation Day, Innovation Jam, Discovery Session, Idea Rally, Shark Tank Business Competition and Confidential Challenges are just a few examples of similar innovation activities.These events aren’t exclusive to programming challenges, and they’re no longer limited to physical audiences. Don’t go MIA and think hackathons are one-and-done, though. Unless you have a broader strategy and well-thought-out plan, then the perception will be that you’re just engaging in innovation theater.Take control of your future by engaging your community (employees, customers, partners, startups, academia and government) with ongoing hackathon-type events. Create an innovation calendar of events that includes these focused campaigns that stimulate creativity within your ecosystem. This demonstrates a true commitment to innovation.Mad Dash To The FutureSet up a task force with a fast and furious focus on clues, clues and more clues from as many relevant sources as possible. But every minute counts: The task force should quickly shift its attention to evaluate these clues and decide which ones to pursue. These ideas represent an organization’s innovation funnel. It’s imperative to keep a healthy pipeline, but you need to advance these ideas and make them actionable so that they can ultimately create value and be worth the effort to scale and commercialize. A sustainable engine that makes use of employee creativity is a neverending exercise that gets to the bottom of things, one sprint at a time.\\xa0Command Your Crystal BallHackathons create the right focus, definition, description, frequency, length, metrics and outcomes to ensure you’re achieving your objectives and creating positive momentum with meaningful results. Challenge your organization to push the envelope and determine your future before your competition does it for you.Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

We\\'re heading back to 2015 when Morgan Housel, then Fool writer, now, New York Times best-selling author, joined us to talk about behavioral finances and biases that could be sabotaging your money. Everyone, to the time machine.This is Motley Fool Answers. I\\'m Alison Southwick and I am joined today by Robert Brokamp, personal finance expert here at The Motley Fool. Hi Bro, how\\'re you doing?Robert Brokamp: Great, Alison. How are you?Southwick: I\\'m good. We have a great show today, because today, we\\'re going to talk about why you should care about a company\\'s corporate culture when you invest. Morgan Housel is going to join us to talk about five biases that are making you bad with money and Bro is also going to answer your questions about how to break up with your mutual fund. All that and more, on this week\\'s episode of Motley Fool Answers.\\xa0The New York Times took Amazon to the woodshed over their corporate culture recently in an article. We\\'ve been used to seeing articles that tell you how awful it is to work in an Amazon warehouse, fulfilling orders and getting books and putting them in boxes, but this recent article talked about how being incorporated in Amazon is actually soul crushing and brutal, all that was in The New York Times, for example, working all hours, crying at your desk. Don\\'t even think about having kids. It was competitive to a fault. Lord of the Flies because I saw it in Florida.Brokamp: No food.Southwick: No free food. They even talked about that. I was just like, \"Come on, I thought you were a tech company.\" So I assume everyone at The Fool read this article because not only do we care about Amazon as investors, we also care about corporate culture. What did you think about the article?Brokamp: My first reaction, whenever I see an article like this, it\\'s based a lot on anecdotes, right?Southwick: They interviewed over 100 people.Brokamp: Right.Southwick: Former Amazon.Brokamp: Right. In Amazon, I don\\'t know how many employees, but it\\'s in the tens of thousands. The point is, I think for any company you could find 100 people who have some sad tales to tell. Now, as you hinted at though, Amazon has already been in the news over the years for working conditions. So I think that\\'s part of why it was easier for people to believe some of this stuff. My first thought was a little skeptical in terms of how pervasive all this stuff is. But I didn\\'t think that, to a certain degree, I\\'m a little concerned that people will take this lesson from Amazon, and it was with Steve Jobs as well, is that for it to be a really successful company to take over the world, you have to be a little cutthroat. You have to be brutal. Steve Jobs had that reputation for being brutally honest with people and according to a New York Times article that Amazon, you are encouraged to rip apart people\\'s opinions. Now, if you\\'ve read some of the responses of Amazon employees, current and former, a lot of them saying that\\'s all a bunch of bull, might have happened here and there, but not everywhere. But to me, one of the concerns I would have is that people take this lesson. If you want to be a great company, you actually have to act like this.Southwick: Right. It\\'s interesting to see some of the responses in the comments to people just being like, \"Look, it\\'s work. Suck it up.\"Brokamp: That\\'s right.Southwick: Right?Brokamp: That\\'s right. One of my favorite lines was when some Amazon employee or executive pointed toward Microsoft and said, \"We don\\'t want to run a country club.\" Because they have all that nice stuff that you hear about at Google [Alphabet] and those companies and I am to say there\\'s a part of me that agrees with that. I mean, The Motley Fool bleeds its culture and we have lots of perks too and every once in a while, I think we, as a company, need to provide that, but it comes from a good place, so to speak, and that is many of our investors here believe that the culture of a company is reflected on how successful the company becomes and thus the stock price. If you make a good workplace for high-performing people, you\\'re going to have low turnover, they\\'re going to be willing to work hard for you, maybe even for less pay. But because of the company environment, the flexibility, something like that, is worth it. They stick with you and turnover at a company can be deadly because every time someone leaves and you have to hire someone, you have to train them up again and things like that. Which is another point that made me question a little bit about The New York Times article: if it\\'s that bad to work at Amazon, why aren\\'t the very smartest people avoiding them and going to Google and Facebook, and Microsoft, why would you choose Amazon if it\\'s that bad?Southwick: Yeah. When I was reading the article and I was in the middle article I was like, \"Boy, I wonder if I should keep investing in Amazon and then should buy stuff.\" As I was reading the article, I knew that there were two boxes from Amazon sitting on my front stoop while I was reading it.Brokamp: It is exactly what my wife said when I told her about this, Like, \"It makes me not want to buy from them anymore.\"Southwick: Yeah. Do you really think you\\'re not going to buy from Amazon?Brokamp: Basically, my bottom line is I want to see more about whether this happens or not. But would that affect, if this stuff turns out to be more true than not, with that affect whether I buy from Amazon? I think it would.Southwick: Yeah. I just want to say to anyone who works at Amazon, if you\\'re listening, I really appreciate the work you do. I really love Amazon Prime, so thanks.Brokamp: Yeah.Southwick: If you are going through hell. Thank you for going through hell, so I can get stuff delivered in two days. That makes me sound like such a bad person.\\xa0[...]Today, we have Morgan Housel joining us.Morgan Housel: Yes.Southwick: Hey, thanks for coming. He is the senior analyst for Motley Fool One with an expertise in behavioral finance. Thanks for joining us today.Housel: Thanks for having me.Southwick: So what are we talking about when we talk about behavioral finance? Because it sounds like a college course that I maybe would have audited.Housel: It does, but I think it\\'s really important. I think for decades and decades, almost essentially finance was taught as purely a math based subject. You learned the formulas and you plug your data into the formulas, and it gives you an answer and that\\'s finance. I think there\\'s a big appreciation in the last 10 or 20 years, that finance is much closer to something like psychology or sociology where what really matters, where you can really set yourself apart is by understanding and knowing and mastering your own mind. Most of that is just acknowledging and understanding the behavioral biases that everyone falls for. Just little tricks that your mind plays on yourself that steers people in the wrong direction in finance and investing.Southwick: I\\'m so glad you did that, because that was a great segue into talking about the five biases that we\\'re going to talk about today.Brokamp: How convenient.Southwick: It\\'s almost like we planned this.Housel: Almost. We actually did it though, it just happened.Southwick: I don\\'t know. Let\\'s just pick five biases. Actually, there\\'s like many biases out there that impact us when we\\'re investing. But you are here to talk about five today for our listeners to consider when it comes to managing their money. The first one is the Dunning–Kruger effect.Brokamp: I hope this has to do with Nightmare on Elm Street.Housel: It does. What the Dunning–Kruger effect is, is when you are so unknowledgeable in such a novice at something that you don\\'t know how bad you are.Southwick: The unknown unknowns.Housel: The unknown unknowns. This is really just something that obviously afflicts people who are just starting out in investing and whatnot. There\\'s just really fascinating study done about 10 years ago where there\\'s a group of finance professors that asked a group of investors, how do you perform as an investor? What returns do you earn? They asked them and then they looked at their brokerage statements and saw how they actually performed, and the worst investors, people who earned the worst returns by far, were the worst up telling them what they thought their actual returns were. So these people were so bad at investing that they didn\\'t even have the skills or the knowledge to go and calculate how bad they were doing. They were so bad and they didn\\'t know how bad they were.Southwick: But they were still happy.Housel: But we see this a lot, I think, with new investors that they don\\'t know enough to know how bad they are, and they need someone to hold them, reveal the curtain, and show them how poorly they\\'re doing.Southwick: Because it is easy to forget, especially in the market that we\\'ve been in, it\\'s easy to forget that, well, I don\\'t need to compare myself to the benchmark of the S&P. Look how awesome I\\'m doing. Then when I compare myself to the S&P, then it\\'s just ugly.Housel: That was really true, I think in the late \\'90s when a lot of people were earning what looked like high returns. Look, I earned 15%, 20% of my money, but that wasn\\'t a year when the S&P gained 35%. They think they were doing really well, they were doing really well, but when you pull back the curtain, and gain a little more knowledge about how well they should\\'ve been doing, it was a disaster.Southwick: All right. Next one we\\'re going to talk about is the frequency illusion.Housel: We were actually just talking earlier about, we thought there was a baby boom here at The Motley Fool.Southwick: One of us thought there was a baby.Brokamp: Maybe the one who was having a baby.Housel: Then we brought up that no, there\\'s probably actually not, it\\'s just because maybe one of us was paying more attention to it. That\\'s exactly what the frequency illusion is, is that it seems like things happen more often once you start paying attention to it, but they\\'re not. I think a good example of this in investing is after the 2008 market crash, there was so much commentary about today\\'s volatile market, stock market, so volatile for years after that but the three years after the market crash in 2008 was below average volatility. It\\'s just we were paying more attention to it, because we were aware it\\'s from 2008. We see this a lot with shark attacks in the news. Once there was one, then we started reporting on them, shark attack here, and shark attack there.Southwick: But right now, it\\'s like grizzly bear attacks.Housel: But if you look at the data --Southwick: It\\'s in the news all the time, grizzly bear attacks.Housel: For a lot of that though, if you look at the data, it\\'s not that there\\'s more occurrences, it\\'s just that we start paying attention to it more often.Southwick: Also, there\\'s a grizzly bear in my backyard. I don\\'t know why.Housel: Right, and a shark in your pool.Southwick: Right, I don\\'t know how it got there.Brokamp: Let\\'s get both of them together, and see what happens.Southwick: But I guess surprisingly, it\\'s always been there, and I\\'m now noticing it because it\\'s in the news. The next one we have is the curse of knowledge.Housel: Yeah.Southwick: I want to guess that it\\'s the opposite of the Dunning–Kruger effect. It may not.Housel: No, it pretty much is. When you have people like stockbrokers, financial advisors, or college professors who don\\'t understand that average lay people think differently than them, and can\\'t understand the language, and jargon that they use.Southwick: It sounds elitist.Housel: It kind of is, yeah. The effect of it is you have stockbrokers that will sit down with their clients, and start throwing around all kinds of lingo. That might seem basic to the stockbroker, but the client has no idea what he\\'s talking about, and they\\'re too afraid to ask. Where we also see it a lot is with economic professors, who a lot of their theories in their models are based on this idea that all consumers will act rationally, and are perfectly informed. That\\'s the basis. That\\'s the foundation of their theories, when in reality, that\\'s total nonsense because most people don\\'t have the kind of math, and economical thinking, and experience that college professors do. It just leads a lot of people astray, because you have these finance professors, and stockbrokers who say, \"This is how you should be acting in theory,\" when the world works totally differently in practice.Southwick: Right.Brokamp: That\\'s part of the whole thing about biases. Really, the other word for it is mistakes, right?Housel: I prefer but it sounds better.Southwick: It sounds --Brokamp: Both around mistakes, and that was part of the root of behavioral finance to begin with, is that there was this assumption for a long time that people who are rational have made the right decisions. Whereas actually, it turns out we\\'re mostly emotional. Most money decisions have to do with emotions, and feelings in my opinion, more than intellectual, rational decisions. That\\'s the basis of all of the stuff.Southwick: We make the decisions with our emotions then we spend all this time trying to rationalize. They make it sound like it was actually a logical choice.Brokamp: They\\'re trying to get the brain into it afterwards.Southwick: After your God made the call. All right. The next one is called extreme discounting.Housel: Right. That\\'s when you want a small reward today over a larger reward in the future.Southwick: This sounds like the kids in the marshmallows study.Housel: You know, I hate the marshmallow test.Southwick: You hate the marshmallow test?Housel: I hate the marshmallow test.Southwick: Okay, so this is the one where they put some kids in a room, and they said, \"You can have one marshmallow now, but I\\'m going to leave and come back, and if you don\\'t eat that marshmallow, I\\'ll give you two marshmallows.\"Housel: Right.Brokamp: Yeah, and then they track those kids for decades, and the ones who were able to resist were smarter, better looking, and more successful, that kind of stuff.Southwick: But Morgan hates this study.Housel: I hate it for a couple of reasons. For one, it\\'s cited in every single psychology book.Southwick: Which must be how I know it.Housel: I feel like everyone who writes about it they\\'re like, \"Oh, I found this crazy test, and it\\'s 9,000 times horrendous in the last year,\" that\\'s the first reason. No. 2, there\\'s actually some evidence that it never really happened as people explained it. There were several different versions of the marshmallow test, and some journalists blended them together to make it a cool story. But if you go back and read the original literature, it\\'s not really as it actually happened. It\\'s similar, but it\\'s not as clean and simple. We\\'re going off track here, is that OK?Southwick: We\\'re not going off track.Housel: The third reason I hate the marshmallow test --Brokamp: You don\\'t get a marshmallow.Housel: This doesn\\'t get talked about a lot. But the kids who actually did well in the marshmallow test, it wasn\\'t because they had more self control, it\\'s because they distracted themselves. It wasn\\'t because they sat there, and looked at the marshmallow, and said, \"I\\'m not going to eat that because I want another one.\" The kids who were able to put it off are the kids who were so ADD that they put them in this room, and then they started playing with their shoes, and singing a song, and banging on the walls. That\\'s why they didn\\'t eat the marshmallow because they were distracted, not because they had patience.Brokamp: The lesson is being ADD, that is the secret.Housel: That\\'s what\\'s funny about it, being distracted is probably the opposite of patience or close to it.Southwick: That\\'s true. I\\'m not going to try out the marshmallow study ever again.Housel: I appreciate that.Southwick: Morgan says it\\'s bunked.Rick Engdahl: All fluff.Housel: I appreciate that.Brokamp: Thank you, Rick, the producer.Southwick: Rick from the control room with the zinger. Tonight\\'s show is completely different, folks. Extreme discounting.Housel: It\\'s wanting a small reward today over a bigger reward tomorrow. Some discounting is rational. But I think you have extreme discounting in investing where people who have 30 years before retirement are constantly focused and investing for returns of the next quarter or the next year. It\\'s just this extreme focus on the short term, when your goals are long term. You see, almost all money managers are graded by the quarter. How did you perform last quarter when most investors are investing for the next few years or decades? There\\'s this funny story from Larry Fink, he\\'s the CEO of BlackRock. He was having lunch with the president of one of the largest endowment funds in the world. The endowment funds said, \"Our goals are generational. We\\'re investing for the next generation, and our grandkids\\' generation,\" and Larry Fink said, \"That\\'s great. How do you measure your performance in the [...] quarterly?\" That\\'s extreme discounting, and it\\'s pervasive across investors, amateur or professional.Brokamp: But fund managers are forced to do it. They shouldn\\'t agree. It\\'s because the investors are focusing on the quarter. As a fund manager, if you have a bad year, money is going to go out the door.Housel: You\\'re fired. Money is the core. Eventually, you\\'re going to be fired.Brokamp: Even though they know, they should be focusing long term therefore, because of the biases of the shareholders.Housel: Right. It\\'s our problem.Brokamp: It is true. In the end folks, it\\'s all your fault.Housel: All extreme discounting is just intense focus on the short run when your goals are way longer down the road.Southwick: Which at The Motley Fool, as long-term investors, our goals are way down the road at least three to five years.Housel: Right.Brokamp: Actually, we\\'re having a discussion earlier today with some colleagues about how if you worked in Richmond, and you want to get a job with Philip Morris, and same with some of the other companies, you had to smoke like you had to fit into the culture there. We thought about that short-term view of things. I\\'m going to smoke today to have this job. I\\'m going to pay for it [laughs] 20, 30 years down the road, but I want that job now.Housel: But it\\'s like if I smoke, I\\'ll have this job in 20 years. But you won\\'t, because you\\'re smoking and you\\'re going to die.Brokamp: That\\'s right. It\\'s an early retirement, folks.Southwick: The last one we\\'re going to talk about is the bias bias. Did you make this one up?Housel: Yes. I couldn\\'t think of a better name for it. But I think the bias, when I started writing about bias, I noticed that there were a lot of people who effectively said, \"That\\'s cool, but this doesn\\'t apply to me.\" I think that\\'s what the bias is thinking when you\\'re reading out behavioral psychology, behavioral finance, and all the mistakes people make. You think it\\'s something that applies to someone else, and not yourself. I think almost everyone thinks this. They read about extreme discounting, and frequency illusion. They think that\\'s something that other people will fall for, but I would never fall for that. I\\'m a long-term thinker. I will never do that, but almost everyone does. Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work in behavioral finance, said something along the lines. I\\'m paraphrasing. He said something like, \"When I\\'m doing this research, I realize that I\\'m writing about myself because of these mistakes that hurt other people.\" The only difference between Kahneman and these people, is that he\\'s aware of it, and he understands what\\'s going on, but everyone is making the same mistakes.Southwick: Is awareness the first step?Housel: It\\'s the first step.Southwick: Acknowledging you have a problem is the first step too.Housel: That\\'s right. There definitely is an extent to, if you\\'re aware of these and you think about them, you come up with a plan that you can make yourself a better thinker, and help yourself versus where you were before. But I think a lot of these are natural biases that have been engrained through evolution that, I don\\'t think virtually anyone is going to completely cure themselves. But that\\'s where if you\\'re aware of them, you can set up your portfolio instead of your expectations to work around them, but you\\'re never going to get rid of them.Southwick: Got to hack yourself.Brokamp: In that vein, which bias do you find yourself falling for most often?Housel: I think probably bias is bias.Brokamp: You think you\\'re better than everyone else.Housel: Yeah, but I think everyone does. No one wants to admit, I\\'m totally flawed and I\\'m a bad thinker, and I can\\'t control my emotions. Because I think if people thought that about themselves, they\\'d have a hard time making it through the day. Most people just to make it through the day have to think I\\'m making good decisions. That\\'s how you can wake up in the morning, and look at yourself in the mirror, and say, I\\'m making good decisions. But a lot of people don\\'t.Southwick: Existential eggs of Morgan Housel.Brokamp: I\\'m going to make a bad decision.\\xa0Southwick: One after another.\\xa0Brokamp: I\\'ve done enough with money as much as Alison will know. Compare money to diet, health and exercise and I\\'m often grabbing something, I\\'m about to eat it, and I know I shouldn\\'t. I know it\\'s not going to help me accomplish my goal of losing weight or staying in better shape or avoiding having three heart attacks like my dad. But I watch it in slow-motion coming toward my mouth, and I know I\\'m making that decision, but I do it anyway.Housel: I know a lot of very smart financial advisors who are some of the smartest investors that I know, that give great advice and every time I hear them talk or write something I\\'m like, \"This guide knows his own.\" But then you become friends with them. You learn about their personal life. Their personal financial situation is a disaster. That\\'s all. It\\'s really easy to think you\\'re doing everything right and to be able to talk about how to do things right, but actually putting it into practice is harder than it looks.Southwick: Before we go, Morgan, what\\'s your best piece of advice for our listeners for their next steps when it comes to mastering their biases. Is there maybe a book they can read or what do you think would be most helpful for our people?Housel: Daniel Kahneman\\'s book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, is the combination of his life\\'s work. Is just an amazing book. Is a dense read, it\\'s not bedtime reading, It\\'s just an amazing look at the human mind and how we trick ourselves called Thinking, Fast and Slow.Brokamp: Interesting thing about him is he has a financial advisor. Despite all he knows, he doesn\\'t manage at least all his own money. That\\'s a good thing too, if you get a trusted professional who can stop you when you want to make some of these big mistakes. It\\'s probably helpful too.Housel: Funny story about his financial advisor too, he\\'s done very well, he won the Nobel Prize He gets paid a lot for speaking. Daniel Kahneman has done well for himself financially. Few years ago, he went to a financial advisor, and he said, \"I don\\'t need to become richer. I just want to live out my days in comfort, but I don\\'t need to make any more money,\" and his advisors said, \"I can\\'t work with you.\" He has had to find a new one. He uses that as an example of financial advisors not understanding the human element of risk-taking. Kahneman said, \"I don\\'t have the psychology to handle a lot of market risk and I don\\'t need the money to begin with, so just keep me steady.\" The financial advisors said, \"That\\'s not what we do.\"Southwick: Yeah. I\\'m here to make you money.Housel: Right. So he found someone else after that.Southwick: Morgan, you had a running column in the Wall Street Journal which means that your face was what they call [...]. They made you a little dot picture.Housel: You know what\\'s crazy about that? They do those by hand.Southwick: That is crazy.Housel: The Journal started doing this 120 years ago, and then they just kept the tradition. They not only kept the pictures, but kept the original way of doing it, which is a guy in the back with a pen and just dot dot dot. It takes some 10 hours per picture to do it.Brokamp: Were you happy with the results?Housel: Not really.Southwick: I\\'ve seen it. It doesn\\'t look like you. It looks like you with 20-30 pounds.Housel: That\\'s what people say.Southwick: It\\'s like chubby you.Brokamp: You\\'ve been fatified.Southwick: You\\'ve been fatified but I would still take financial advice from you, if that makes you.Housel: Makes me feel better.Southwick: If that makes you feel better. You maybe didn\\'t look as handsome as you are, but you still got the brains in there. Well, Morgan, thank you for joining us. This has been a lot of fun.Housel: Thanks for having me.Southwick: We\\'re going to have you back.Housel: All right.Southwick: We\\'re going to talk more.Housel: Great. I work upstairs. So it\\'s no problem.Southwick: Wonderful.Housel: Good.Southwick: Thanks. We have received a ton of mail from you guys, which is awesome. Here\\'s where I feel bad because it\\'s going to take us a while to get through all the letters, but we\\'re going to do our darnedest. The first question this week comes to us from Boris. He writes, \"In my IRA accounts, I have funds from Vanguard, Amana, Royce, T. Rowe Price, Baron, Hennessy. It is a bit of a mess. Some funds I have kept for 15-20 years, others are relatively new additions. I was wondering if you can provide some suggestions and tips on deciding when to sell a fund. I normally look at performance compared to other funds in the portfolio, but it\\'s hard to compare across different sectors. I try to use the Morningstar rating, but each fund seems to have a handful of those as well. Do I look at the overall ratings?\"Brokamp: Great question, Boris. Morningstar is my go-to source for information about mutual funds. You can go to morningstar.com, you put a quote for the mutual fund, and then you hit the Performance tab. The important thing about evaluating the performance of a mutual fund is you have to compare it to similar funds. These extreme examples, you would never compare a bond fund to an S&P 500 index fund. You want to be comparing international funds to international funds, small-cap funds to small-cap funds. On that performance page, if you scroll down, you will see category rank. The lower the number, the better. So if you see that your fund is in the category rank of 10, that means it is in the top 10% of those funds for that category. You want to look at a longer-term period, at least five years, 10 years. But actually, studies show the number one predictor of future fund performance are expenses; so I would look first at expenses. You want below average expenses then look at performance.Southwick: Below average is?Brokamp: Below average while it depends on the type of fund it is. Morningstar will also, on the expenses, give a fee level. It will say low, below average, average high to do that. Then performance, management tenure, you want someone who\\'s been managing the fund for at least five years. The Morningstar star rating. Morningstar acknowledges that that is a backward looking analysis that is not necessarily predictive. It has some predictive characteristics a little bit, but for the most part, ignore the stars that just tells you what it did, not necessarily what it\\'s going to do.Southwick: All right. Cool. This is when we segue into Sam\\'s question. Sam writes, \"I\\'ve invested in mutual funds, but thanks to your advice, I\\'ve been thinking about transferring to lower-cost index funds.\" That\\'s my yay. I\\'m putting in the yay. \"The problem is that I get wet feet about paying thousands of dollars in income taxes for selling and rebuying such a large portion of my holdings. Do you have any soothing thoughts to help me take the plunge?\"Brokamp: Well, it\\'s a great question. It\\'s a bit of a dilemma. It depends on the tax bite because let\\'s say you have $10,000 in a fund. You sell it because of taxes, you have to pay a 1,000, so you\\'re left with 9,000. You\\'re really asking, should I have just kept 10,000 in the old investments or I\\'m going to be better off putting 9,000, now that I pay tax, into this new one? You have to basically think, how long will it take for that smaller investment in my new investment to overtake the other one. It really depends on the degree to which your current investment stinks compared to an index fund. If you have a fund that is high-cost, underperformed its benchmark by 2% or 3% a year, I would say do it for sure. I mean, if it\\'s a long-term holding you\\'re going to hold for five, 10, 15, 20 years, you\\'re going to be better off in the end. If you have a fund that is only marginally worse than a index fund. If it\\'s still below average costs, which many actively managed funds are, it may not be as compelling.\\xa0The other thing to keep in mind is you don\\'t have to do it all at once. Chances are, you bought the mutual fund over different periods, you actually, let\\'s say you got into mutual fund through five different purchases. You\\'ve put in 2,000 in point, and 2,000 another point, and 2,000 another point. You actually can choose which of those portions to sell. One might have a huge capital gain, which would cause lots of taxes. The other one maybe it\\'s just the marginal capital gain, it wouldn\\'t cost you so much in taxes. You can tell the fund company, I just want to sell those shares. You don\\'t have to do it all at once. You can identify the shares, but you have to contact the mutual fund company on how to do that because each company has a little bit of their own way of letting them know. Otherwise, there is a default when you tell them to sell, and they\\'re going to choose the shares that you sold them and they may not be the best ones to sell from a tax perspective.Southwick: Wonderful. Thanks, Bro.Brokamp: My pleasure.Southwick: Those were great answers. All right. Boris and Sam, hopefully that was helpful.

Week pitch competition Thursday night at Hood College. Jachowski was awarded a $5,000 prize.Supporters of ODIN CrossFit cheer following the company’s S.H.E. Pitch Competition pitch Thursday night at Hood College.Supporters of ODIN CrossFit cheer following the company’s S.H.E. Pitch Competition pitch Thursday night at Hood College.The second round of the S.H.E Pitch Competition was just getting started when Helen Propheter, director of Frederick County’s Office of Economic Development, dropped to the polished wooden stage of Hood College’s Hodson Auditorium and tried for a push-up.With no more gift bags to give away, Propheter was stalling for time before Allison Jachowski — co-owner of Frederick’s ODIN CrossFit — was ready to start her presentation. Though Propheter gave a noble effort, high-heeled shoes and all, she soon found herself lying flat on her belly as the audience whooped and cheered. Jachowski watched nearby, laughing.“I can help you with that,” she said with a grin.Jachowski went head-to-head with six other female business leaders on Thursday in a “Shark Tank”-style fight hosted on the second-to-last night of S.H.E. Week, an annual event developed by the county’s chamber of commerce to celebrate women in business.In all, $10,000 was up for grabs. Three new businesses duked it out for the $4,500 “Idea Stage” prize, while three expanding businesses, including Jachowski’s gym, competed for the $5,000 “Growth Stage” prize. Audience members selected an additional winner of the “People’s Choice Award” and $500, while a panel of four judges — which included Hood College President Andrea Chapdelaine, Frederick County Chamber of Commerce President Rick Weldon and two local business owners — chose who would walk away with the first two prizes.The competitors had to speak fast: They only had two minutes to set up their presentations, five minutes to pitch their businesses and three minutes to answer questions from the judges. Hodson Auditorium echoed with the sound of clicking high heels as the women paced around the stage, flicking through sleek slideshows.One thing was for certain, Propheter said — she did not envy the judges for the decision they had to make. The businesses competing ranged from a newly created construction group to a company striving to make the delivery of medicine via needles safer and cheaper.Each one did an “outstanding job,” Propheter said.“You’ve represented Frederick County better than any of us could have,” she remarked. “We couldn’t be more thrilled to have your entrepreneurial spirit here in our county.”Ultimately, ODIN CrossFit came out on top in the Growth Stage competition and received the People’s Choice Award. The gym’s members had turned out in droves to support Jachowski — a small crowd exploded to their feet, shouting and applauding, when she was announced the winner. Her 6-year-old son scampered to the stage and hugged his mom around her legs.During her presentation, Jachowski told the judges that she had run ODIN CrossFit with her husband for about six years. She had entered the competition with the hope of using the prize money to help with the gym’s upcoming move to a new 10,000-square-foot space on North Market Street — a significant upgrade from the company’s current 5,600-square-foot space.The new location will allow the business to run more classes at once and give its members easy access to the shops and restaurants downtown Frederick has to offer, Jachowski said, but it is also in need of a “serious facelift.” On top of purchasing new gym equipment, Jachowski and her staff will be installing new plumbing, electrical and HVAC systems inside the facility. In the end, though, she said it will all be worth it to provide her gym family with an upgrade.Sandy Dubay, one of the judges and the owner of Platinum PR, hit Jachowski with a tough final question: How long did she think it would take Propheter to be able to do a full push-up?“If she comes to ODIN, I’d give her a couple weeks,” Jachowski replied to laughter and applause.The judges chose Kara Kelley, co-owner of the budding cottage bakery, Ifey & Blue’s, as winner of the Idea Stage section of the competition. Kelley and her partner were looking for funds to purchase new kitchen equipment, which would allow them to generate more revenue, while saving up for a food truck and giving their “poor KitchenAid its absolute needed break.”Though Ifey & Blue’s started by only pushing hot cocoa bombs when Kelley and her partner created the business last November, it has since expanded to selling custom cake and cupcakes, including cereal-inspired macarons. The duo may one day pursue opening a brick-and-mortar shop, Kelley said, but wanted to start with a food truck so they could build up their reputation and clientele in the community, while also maintaining flexibility to “rock our jobs as mom and dad.”After Kelley finished her presentation, Dubey fired a series of questions at her, then followed up with a final zinger:“And are the samples coming later?”Follow Angela Roberts on Twitter: @24_angierReporter{{description}}Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.So which is it?

              " '18': {'raw text': 'CAPE ANN — Not enough is made of the first person to eat a lobster, for that early human was a special kind of maniac. Hunger will make people do desperate things, but think of all the starving people who came before that who were still like, “Dude, I’m not touching that thing.”That’s because lobsters are terrifying. They are 90 percent weapon. Even after you put the bands on their claws and cook them, they’ll find a way to pull a knife on you.That’s reason No. 1 why I had never so much as touched a lobster, let alone eaten one. Reason No. 2: who has that kind of money?AdvertisementThen I went armed snorkeling.The guy who introduced me to this activity last summer, my buddy Doc, kept referring to it as “spearfishing,” and he seemed weirdly excited by the idea of shooting a fish, sticking it in a bag tied to his waist, and then trolling it behind him as it bled out.For reasons that involve the movie “Jaws,” that didn’t appeal to me. But I was intrigued by the idea that my $10 saltwater fishing license allowed me to walk into the ocean carrying a spear gun. Just the thought made me feel like James Bond, only handsomer.Doc had an extra gun, and though I had no plans to use it I figured carrying it might muffle the “Jaws” music in my head, so I went along for the sightseeing.Almost immediately on that first dive, I completely forgot about the tautog we were supposed to be looking for, because I became preoccupied by the lobsters, which were absolutely everywhere, just sitting there for the taking. Suddenly, it felt like reason No. 2 had been removed. Free lobster!I just had to get over reason No. 1. Because the state of Massachusetts does not allow divers to shoot lobsters. Nor does it allow the use of snares or nets. No, the Commonwealth’s rule for lobster diving is far more intimate and horrifying. You have to grab them with your hands.AdvertisementTypically, this would be the stuff of nightmares. None of the lobsters I saw even had the rubber bands on their claws. But something came over me on that first dive. Maybe it was the gun in my hands. Maybe it was the warm pee in my wetsuit. But for whatever reason, I resolved that it was time to become a free lobster eater.As soon as we got out of the water, I got online and gave the state $55 for a recreational lobster permit. Then I headed to a dive shop for a $45 dive flag, a $75 weighted belt to hold me down when I dove to the bottom, a $10 lobster gauge, and a $30 bag to put them in. But the most important thing I bought was the only tool you are allowed to use lobster diving in Massachusetts, something called a “tickle stick.” I chose one with a pink handle for some reason.A tickle stick, I learned, is a thin rod, about three feet long, with a slightly angled tip. It cost $18, and the idea is that you stick it in the hole behind the lobster, use the angled tip to tickle it on the tail, and hope it marches out to turn around and fight whatever was behind it. That’s when you grab it. Allegedly.AdvertisementBefore our next dive, I realized there was no way I was gonna be able to grab a lobster with both my hands full, so I left the gun in the car, grabbed the tickle stick, and told myself what I always tell myself when the “Jaws” music starts playing in my head:In my lifetime, only one person has been killed by a shark in Massachusetts. In that same period, we’ve produced two famous Wahlbergs. So, statistically speaking, I was twice as likely to become a famous Wahlberg as I was to be killed by a shark. Simple math.I felt decidedly less James Bond-y on that third dive – armed only with a pink tickle stick – but it was so much easier to swim, and I was quickly able to spot two claws peaking out of a hole, dive to the bottom, and get the stick in to tickle its behind.No one was more surprised than me when it worked. The lobster promptly walked out of its hole, turned around, and revealed itself to be roughly the size of a brontosaurus. Whatever breath remained in my lungs left in a scream.Several more dives went like this. Then one morning, Doc and I arrived at the beach to find there was an exercise class going on, filled with a bunch of people I knew, which kind of put the pressure on.AdvertisementI was barely 100 feet offshore when I spotted a lobster, and countered the fear pulsing through my veins by repeating a mantra:You are 180 pounds of man meat. You are 180 pounds of man meat.I took a breath through my snorkel and dove down slowly, but the lobster saw me coming and turned to fight. There was no turning back now, so I used the tickle stick to kind of flip him around, and reached down with my other hand and all my courage and quickly grabbed it in the armpits. I may have had my eyes closed. But when they opened, there was a lobster securely in my hand, and that hand was leading the way toward the surface, where I blasted through like a superhero, making sure I created enough of a splash for everyone on the shore to notice.“Did you get one? You are so manly,” they probably shouted, but I couldn’t quite hear them on account of everything being drowned out by the dazzle coming off me in that moment.That’s when I looked down at my hand to see that the lobster was the size of my palm. It may have been a crayfish.“Just a baby. I’m gonna let it go and find a monster,” I lied, my heart still beating at a panic pace as I contemplated how I was going to release this thing without it coming back and killing me.For the rest of the summer, we dove and tickled, and I even managed to grab a few more, but each time I’d surface and realize the underwater magnification had again made me mistake a midget for a monster. Even when the season ended and winter came, lobsters continued to taunt me in my dreams, whispering: You are 180 pounds of mashed potatoes.AdvertisementWhen summer returned, I was on a mission. I didn’t even care that a lobster diver down the Cape had allegedly been swallowed by a whale. Plus, it had occurred to me that you could make a solid argument that there were four famous Wahlbergs, on account of their reality show, so my odds of getting killed by a shark got halved again.I paid the state another $55 and then we dove, and dove, and dove some more.Then one day, I rounded a rocky point off the coast of Cape Ann and there, in a little canyon, was the lobster I had been looking for. Right size. Right depth. And, most importantly, he was preoccupied with eating a crab. Before either of us really knew what had happened, I had him measured and stuffed in my bag, and was kicking for shore. It was a glorious moment in seafood history.I raced home, and my children were in disbelief when I placed the lobster on our kitchen floor. That’s when reason No. 3 arrived.“You’re really going to boil it alive?” one of them asked.What happened next was its own melodrama, that involved much quiet screaming from me and probably the lobster. But I did it. I cooked and ate a lobster, and it was … OK. Maybe a tad weird because, as one of my children said, “I kind of feel like I know the guy.”But something about the primitive act made me feel connected to that anonymous maniac who first ate a lobster.Plus, think of all the money I saved.Billy Baker can be reached at billy.baker@globe.com.

              " '4': {'raw text': \"Today is the day that Street Shark fans have been waiting for with the upcoming releases of their new figures from Mattel Creations. This past week, we have been celebrating the legacy of the street sharks with a brief recap of their history, as well as covering some of the coolest heroes and villains Mattel created for them. It all has been leading up to today's (August 27, 2021) event with a special Mattel Creations release. Our incredible fans over at Mattel sent us some of these Street Sharks figure to check out, and we will be loading this article out with a closer look. Plus, keep your eyes peeled for reviews of each starting later today and throughout the week.Starting things off first is what the figures are, and that is three concept Street Shark designs that never made it to production. These figures are original concept designs of some alternate possibilities of what the Street Sharks were going to be. Three figures are getting released, which will include the legendary Ripster before he became the shark you know and love. We also have Karkass, who was the precession to Dr. Piranoid, who is more monster than man and really diving into the piranha role. Last but not least, we have my favorite release of Clambo, who is seen in the series as the infamous Clammando. Clammando was originally set to get a toy for the original Street Sharks line and never say never, as he is back with his original concept design and locked and loaded.These Street Sharks figures are more than your average action figure but a symbol of what could have been. Street Sharks is a widely popular and beloved franchise, and as a historian, it's a treat to see these concept designs come to life. Each figure is priced at $75 each, and while that does seem high, these figures are the true treasures for any Street Sharks fan. All three figures will cone in some sweet window-packed box with some fun art on the sides and an iconic logo that just pops. They are nicely detailed, paced with some classic 90s accessories, and will easily be a highlight collectible for any fan's collection. These could even be the stepping stones for a Street Sharks relaunch, and who knows what jawesomeness could arise for the waters after this launch. The Mattel Creations launch is set to take place right here at 12 PM EST, so be sure to set those alarms and stay tuned for an even close look at Ripster, Karkass, and Clambo.Enjoyed this?

With another week of TV gone by, we’re lobbing queries left and right about dozens of shows including The Chair, American Horror Story: Double Feature, The Good Fight and Big Brother!1 |\\xa0As much as we enjoyed The Chair‘s six-episode run, wasn’t it a little hard to believe, during Episode 1, that any college students would start filming their professor just because he asked if anyone was drunk or high during class?2 |\\xa0Now that Bill Kurtis has returned to A&E’s Cold Case Files after a 15-year hiatus, is he the reigning king of true-crime voiceovers, or is Keith Morrison the one to beat? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tblogherads\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.defineSlot( \\'nativemini\\', \\'gpt-Tl-mid-article-inject-uid0\\' )\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.setTargeting( \\'pos\\', [\"mid-article\",\"mid-article1\",\"mid-articleX\",\"btf\",\"mid\",\"300x251\"] )\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\\\/mid-article\")\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.addSize([[2,2],[300,250],[300,251],[2,4],[4,2],[620,350]])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3 |\\xa0Did Legends of Tomorrow even explain Behrad’s absence in the latest episode…?4 |\\xa0Why would The Walking Dead‘s Negan have agreed to go on a mission with Maggie, who he knew wanted to kill him? And why did Carol not go? Also, as TVLine reader Joseph asked: Why would a rope snap when pulling up a case of MREs, but not hoisting much heavier people?5 |\\xa0If, as Animal Kingdom‘s Tommy told Deran, people are whispering that the Codys “took care of” Adrian, is there any world in which you’d feel safe repeating that to him?6 |\\xa0Does Stargirl‘s Pat have any way to describe ISA supervillains other than “very, very bad” or “bad news”?7 |\\xa0How much were you coveting Mi Ran’s pizza on You Are My Spring? And is there a way to order it in real life?8 | Could The Flash‘s recently announced alien-fueled “Armageddon” event in some small way be born of Legends of Tomorrow‘s current, alien-themed season?9 |\\xa0Seriously, who asked for this?10 |\\xa0With a few tweaks, couldn’t Jaime Pressly’s in-the-works CBS sitcom — about “a woman who returns home to the small North Carolina island she couldn’t wait to leave, to bury a mom she couldn’t stand” — be turned into a Jill-centric Mom spinoff? (They can call it\\xa0Dead Mom!)11 |\\xa0Wasn’t Riverdale‘s chainsaw-wielding trucker kind of ruining his own livelihood by carving up his truck’s cab just to get at Betty? (Big rigs are expensive!) And what are these investors thinking, handing tens of thousands of dollars over to Veronica and Reggie over the phone?12 |\\xa0Who was the more conspicuously absent talking head from ABC’s Superstar profile of the late John Ritter — Three’s Company‘s Joyce DeWitt, or 8 Simple Rules‘ Katey Sagal?13 |\\xa0We know it’s supposed to be winter on American Horror Story: Double Feature, but would P-Town really be that deserted?14 |\\xa0Should The Challenge‘s Tori have taken her shot at Big T, or did she make the right call by holding off?15 |\\xa0We know The Other Two was off the air for two-and-a-half years, but wasn’t it still disorienting to see Chase Dreams basically all grown up, with his voice changed and everything?16 |\\xa0As Good Fight co-creators Robert and Michelle King mull whether or not to summon Mandy Patinkin’s Judge Wackner back for Season 6, we gotta ask: Do you want to see more of the eccentric magistrate? Or was one season enough? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tblogherads\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.defineSlot( \\'medrec\\', \\'gpt-Tl-mid-article-inject2-uid1\\' )\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.setTargeting( \\'pos\\', [\"btf\",\"mid-article2\",\"mid-articleX\",\"mid\",\"300x251\"] )\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"ros\\\\/mid-article2\")\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t.addSize([[300,250],[2,2],[300,251],[620,350],[2,4],[4,2]])\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n17 |\\xa0Did anyone at ABC who watched the last live episode of\\xa0The Conners honestly think to themselves, “Gee, that was great!

Did Nine-Drink Amy, with her terrible British accent, sound a lot like Frasier‘s Daphne Moon? And how do we go about getting Stephanie Beatriz cast in Disney+’s forthcoming Sister Act threequel?22 | Do you feel like Making It‘s Season 3 winner got a perhaps-undeserved final nudge due to the eco-conscious nature of their crafting? More so than how they met the Shack Hack’s three judging criteria?23 |\\xa0While we love the heady strategy of Big Brother‘s Cookout alliance, is anyone else a little bored with Season 23? Where are the house flips, split votes and (most importantly) the drama of seasons past?24 |\\xa0See fans, had you forgotten how deliciously batty Queen Kane is? And do you think Lord Harlan is going to be any match for her at all?25 | When all is said and done, is the renewal of Mayim Bialik’s Call Me Kat\\xa0largely to blame for the Jeopardy! mishegas?Hit the comments with your answers — and any other Qs you care to share!Karlovy Vary Winners: \\'As Far As I Can Walk\\' Takes Grand Prix…Justin Verlander and Kate Upton Put Down Waterfront Roots…Rory Kennedy Pleads for Reversal of RFK Assassin\\'s Parole Grant…The Rolling Stones Honor Drummer Charlie Watts With New Video…Want the Best-Looking Visuals?

Sometimes, general feedback is requested, often through surveys, but with no real objective in mind. When it comes to purpose-driven innovation, the first 48 hours are crucial in motivating solution seekers to find and piece together clues. Frame What’s MissingLess is more when it comes to defining what solution you’re looking for. The statement must be fairly straightforward and strikingly simple in what information it communicates. Take control of your future by engaging your community (employees, customers, partners, startups, academia and government) with ongoing hackathon-type events. Create an innovation calendar of events that includes these focused campaigns that stimulate creativity within your ecosystem. But every minute counts: The task force should quickly shift its attention to evaluate these clues and decide which ones to pursue. I help organizations build a sustainable culture of innovation.
